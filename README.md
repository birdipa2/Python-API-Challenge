# Python-API-Challenge
## This repository contains two challenges (folders): WeatherPy and VacationPy.
>### The WeatherPy folder houses the WeatherPy.ipynb notebook, which contains the code, as well as a sub-folder called [output_data] where the results of the code execution are stored.
>
> WeatherPy: Analysis of Weather Variables vs. Latitude
>
>This challenge aims to analyze the relationships between various weather variables and latitude by generating scatter plots and linear regression models. Data was collected from the OpenWeatherMap API for randomly selected cities around the world.
>
>### Dependencies Used
>The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
>
>>Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
>
>>NumPy: A library for numerical computations and handling arrays.
>
>>Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
>
>>Requests: A library for making HTTP requests in Python.
>
>>Scipy: A library for scientific and technical computing.
>
>>OpenWeatherMap API: An API to access weather data for any location on Earth.
>
>### Instructions to Use the Code
>Ensure that you have all the required dependencies installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:
>
>>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib requests scipy
>
>Sign up for a free API key on the OpenWeatherMap website (https://openweathermap.org/api).
>
>Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the code with the actual API key you received.
>
>Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment. The code will generate scatter plots and linear regression models for the relationships between latitude and various weather variables.
>
>Analyze the generated plots and regression models to draw conclusions about the relationships between the weather variables and latitude.
>
>Save the generated plots as images in the output folder by uncommenting the plt.savefig() lines in the code.
>
>Combine the results and analysis from each part of the code to create a comprehensive report on the relationships between latitude and the weather variables.
